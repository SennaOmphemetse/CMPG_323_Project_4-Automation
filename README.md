This project focuses on Test Automation where i create the c# application on the UIpath that will test the website. The UIpath application will automatically add items of different fields like Device, Category etc to the website reading from the excel spreadsheets and also ceating a tables in the UIpath application that will store that read data. The UIpath application will also write some of the boolean cases to the same spreadsheet to indicate whether the process of creating, reading, editing and deleting was successful.
